# Ethora (Dappros Platform) API

Studying this section is optional. You can build your apps using Ethora engine without having to study the API documentation.

_Note: for information on interacting with our XMPP messaging server and other RTC (Real-Time Communication) components beyond those covered in the API, please refer to this manual: https://github.com/dappros/ethora/blob/main/api/chats.md_.
_For additional information regarding the Push Notifications please refer to https://github.com/dappros/ethora/blob/main/api/pushes.md_



This section will be useful for developers who are looking to:
1) Better understand how our platform works
2) Extend their apps functionality beyond the code currently available in Ethora client engines (React Native for iOS/Android and React.js for Web)
3) Interact with their apps and server data through their own 3rd party logic (for example, import/export users with your legacy system via Users API etc), create their own server extensions, chat bots etc

## Older API documentation

Older, manually written, non-Swagger API documentation is available here:
https://www.dappros.com/developers/#introduction

This version doesn't cover all the latest additions but may still be useful as it describes in detail different sections and features of Dappros Platform API. Dappros Platform is simply our backend-as-a-service (with web3/blockchain and chat/messaging features) server-side platform which was created first before we have created the Ethora client-side app engine.
